You can create a transformation that can dynamically change what it does depending on a definition input. This DataWeave example receives both a payload input, and a variable named `mappings` that specifies how to rename each field and what default value to use in each.
//LINK TO DW 1.0 EXAMPLES:
include::partial$dataweave1-links.adoc[tag=dataweave1Examples]

The example uses the following:

* A `map` function to go through all of the elements in the input array. Also a second `map` function to go through each field in each element.
* A custom function that applies the changes specified in the `mappings` variable.
* `default` to set a default value, that comes from the `mappings` variable.
