= COBOL Copybook Format


MIME Type: `application/flatfile`

ID: `flatfile`

A COBOL copybook is a type of flat file that describes the layout of records and fields in a COBOL data file.

The Transform Message component provides settings for handling the COBOL copybook format. For example, you can import a COBOL definition into the Transform Message component and use it for your Copybook transformations.

NOTE: COBOL copybook in DataWeave supports files of up to 15 MB, and the memory requirement is roughly 40 to 1. For example, a 1-MB file requires up to 40 MB of memory to process, so it's important to consider this memory requirement in conjunction with your TPS needs for large copybook files. This is not an exact figure; the value might vary according to the complexity of the mapping instructions.

== Importing a Copybook Definition

When you import a Copybook definition, the Transform Message component converts the definition to a flat file schema that you can reference with `schemaPath` property.

To import a copybook definition:

. Right-click the input payload in the Transform component in Studio, and select *Set Metadata* to open the Set Metadata Type dialog.
+
Note that you need to create a metadata type before you can import a copybook
definition.
+
. Provide a name for your copybook metadata, such as `copybook`.
. Select the Copybook type from the *Type* drop-down menu.
. Import your copybook definition file.
. Click Select.

For example, assume that you have a copybook definition file
(`mailing-record.cpy`) that looks like this:

----
       01  MAILING-RECORD.
           05  COMPANY-NAME            PIC X(30).
           05  CONTACTS.
               10  PRESIDENT.
                   15  LAST-NAME       PIC X(15).
                   15  FIRST-NAME      PIC X(8).
               10  VP-MARKETING.
                   15  LAST-NAME       PIC X(15).
                   15  FIRST-NAME      PIC X(8).
               10  ALTERNATE-CONTACT.
                   15  TITLE           PIC X(10).
                   15  LAST-NAME       PIC X(15).
                   15  FIRST-NAME      PIC X(8).
           05  ADDRESS                 PIC X(15).
           05  CITY                    PIC X(15).
           05  STATE                   PIC XX.
           05  ZIP                     PIC 9(5).
----

* Copybook definitions must always begin with a `01` entry. A separate record
  type is generated for each `01` definition in your copybook (there must be at
  least one `01` definition for the copybook to be usable, so add one using an
  arbitrary name at the start of the copybook if none is present). If there are
  multiple `01` definitions in the copybook file, you can select which
  definition to use in the transform from the dropdown list.
* COBOL format requires definitions to only use columns 7-72 of each line. Data
  in columns 1-5 and past column 72 is ignored by the import process. Column 6
  is a line continuation marker.

When you import the schema, the Transform component converts the copybook file
to a flat file schema that it stores in the `src/main/resources/schema` folder
of your Mule project. In flat file format, the copybook definition above looks
like this:

----
form: COPYBOOK
id: 'MAILING-RECORD'
values:
- { name: 'COMPANY-NAME', type: String, length: 30 }
- name: 'CONTACTS'
  values:
  - name: 'PRESIDENT'
    values:
    - { name: 'LAST-NAME', type: String, length: 15 }
    - { name: 'FIRST-NAME', type: String, length: 8 }
  - name: 'VP-MARKETING'
    values:
    - { name: 'LAST-NAME', type: String, length: 15 }
    - { name: 'FIRST-NAME', type: String, length: 8 }
  - name: 'ALTERNATE-CONTACT'
    values:
    - { name: 'TITLE', type: String, length: 10 }
    - { name: 'LAST-NAME', type: String, length: 15 }
    - { name: 'FIRST-NAME', type: String, length: 8 }
- { name: 'ADDRESS', type: String, length: 15 }
- { name: 'CITY', type: String, length: 15 }
- { name: 'STATE', type: String, length: 2 }
- { name: 'ZIP', type: Integer, length: 5, format: { justify: ZEROES, sign: UNSIGNED } }
----

After importing the copybook, you can use the `schemaPath` property to reference the associated flat file through the `output` directive. For example:
`output application/flatfile schemaPath="src/main/resources/schemas/mailing-record.ffd"`

== Supported Copybook Features

Not all copybook features are supported by the COBOL Copybook format in
DataWeave. In general, the format supports most common usages and simple
patterns, including:

* USAGE of DISPLAY, BINARY (COMP), COMP-5, and PACKED-DECIMAL (COMP-3).
For character encoding restrictions, see <<character_encoding>>.
* PICTURE clauses for numeric values consisting only of:
** '9' - One or more numeric character positions
** 'S' - One optional sign character position, leading or trailing
** 'V' - One optional decimal point
** 'P' - One or more decimal scaling positions
* PICTURE clauses for alphanumeric values consisting only of 'X' character positions
* Repetition counts for '9', 'P', and 'X' characters in PICTURE clauses
  (as in `9(5)` for a 5-digit numeric value)
* OCCURS DEPENDING ON with `controlVal` property in schema. Note that if the
  control value is nested inside a containing structure, you need to manually
  modify the generated schema to specify the full path for the value in the
  form "container.value".
* REDEFINES clause (used to provide different views of the same portion of
  record data - see details in section below)

_Unsupported_ features include:

* Alphanumeric-edited PICTURE clauses
* Numeric-edited PICTURE clauses, including all forms of insertion, replacement, and zero suppression
* Special level-numbers:
** Level 66 - Alternate name for field or group
** Level 77 - Independent data item
** Level 88 - Condition names (equivalent to an enumeration of values)
* SIGN clause at group level (only supported on elementary items with PICTURE clause)
* USAGE of COMP-1 or COMP-2 and of clause at group level (only supported on elementary items with PICTURE clause)
* VALUE clause (used to define a value of a data item or conditional name from
  a literal or another data item)
* SYNC clause (used to align values within a record)

== REDEFINES Support

REDEFINES facilitates dynamic interpretation of data in a record. When you import a
copybook with REDEFINES present, the generated schema uses a special grouping
with the name '*' (or '*1', '*2', and so on, if multiple REDEFINES groupings are present
at the same level) to combine all the different interpretations. You use this
special grouping name in your DataWeave expressions just as you use any other
grouping name.

Use of REDEFINES groupings has higher overhead than normal copybook groupings,
so MuleSoft recommends that you remove REDEFINES from your copybooks where possible
before you import them into Studio.

[[character_encoding]]
== Character Encodings

BINARY (COMP), COMP-5, or PACKED-DECIMAL (COMP-3) usages are only supported
with single-byte character encodings, which use the entire range of 256 potential
character codes. UTF-8 and other variable-length encodings are not supported for
these usages (because they're not single-byte), and ASCII is also not supported
(because it doesn't use the entire range). Supported character encodings include
ISO-8859-1 (an extension of ASCII to full 8 bits) and other 8859 variations and
EBCDIC (IBM037).

REDEFINES requires you to use a single-byte-per-character character encoding for
the data, but any single-byte-per-character encoding can be used unless BINARY
(COMP), COMP-5, or PACKED-DECIMAL (COMP-3) usages are included in the data.

== Common Copybook Import Issues

The most common issue with copybook imports is a failure to follow the COBOL
standard for input line regions. The copybook import parsing ignores the
contents of columns 1-6 of each line, and ignores all lines with an '*'
(asterisk) in column 7. It also ignores everything beyond column 72 in each line.
This means that all your actual data definitions need to be within columns 8
through 72 of input lines.

Tabs in the input are not expanded because there is no defined standard for tab
positions. Each tab character is treated as a single space character when
counting copybook input columns.

Indentation is ignored when processing the copybook, with only level-numbers
treated as significant. This is not normally a problem, but it means that
copybooks might be accepted for import even though they are not accepted by
COBOL compilers.

Both warnings and errors might be reported as a result of a copybook import.
Warnings generally tell of unsupported or unrecognized features, which might or
might not be significant. Errors are notifications of a problem that means the
generated schema (if any) will not be a completely accurate representation of
the copybook. You should review any warnings or errors reported and decide on
the appropriate handling, which might be simply accepting the schema as
generated, modifying the input copybook, or modifying the generated schema.
