In this guide, you run DataWeave 2.0 scripts on sample data, without relying
on external data sources.
//LINK TO DW 1.0 LANDING PAGE IN MULE 3.9 DOCS:
include::partial$dataweave1-links.adoc[tag=dataweave1LandingPage]

The examples introduce some key DataWeave concepts
that you can explore further whenever you are ready, and they show how to turn
the Transform Message component into a DataWeave playground.

To run the scripts, you copy them into the source code area of a Transform
Message component in xref:studio::index.adoc[Studio], then view the results
in the component's *Preview* pane. You also load content from files so that
your DataWeave script can act on it. Once you feel comfortable with DataWeave
examples here and elsewhere in the docs, you can use the DataWeave playground
to practice writing your own DataWeave scripts on sample data.

[[example1]]
image::dw-tut-script-studio-basic.png["A script in Anypoint Studio showing a basic JSON output"]

The figure shows a Transform Message component in the center canvas, within *testingscriptFlow*. Below the Studio canvas, the *Transform Message* tab
includes a DataWeave script in the source code area with output in the
*Preview* pane.

== Prerequisites

xref:studio::to-download-and-install-studio.adoc[Studio 7] is required.
Versions 7.3 or 7.2.3 are recommended. Other Studio 7 versions are untested
with this guide.

Once Studio is installed, you need to set up a project with a Transform Message component. See <<setup>>.

[[setup]]
== Set Up a Project in Studio

Set up a Mule project that serves as a DataWeave playground:

. In Studio, click *File* -> *New* -> *Mule Project* to create a Mule project.
. Provide the name `testscript` for the project, and click *Finish*.
. From the *Mule Palette* tab of your new project, click *Core*, and then drag the *Transform Message* component into the Studio canvas.
+

// &#40;C&#41; avoids conversion to copyright symbol:
&#40;C&#41; *Transform Message* tab
+
. In the *Transform Message* tab, click *Preview* (on the far right) to open
the Preview pane, and click the _empty_ rectangle next to *Preview* to expand
the source code area.
+
[[studio_source_only]]
image::studio-transform-msg-tab.png["A Transform Message tab showing an output payload in Anypoint Studio"]
+
The source code area on the left is the place where you are going to add
DataWeave scripts, and the Preview pane on the right is where you view the
output of the scripts.
+
. Proceed to <<start_scripting>>.

[[step_1]]
=== Concatenate Two Strings into a Single String

Begin with a simple DataWeave script that concatenates two strings ("hello" and
"World") together into a single string ("helloWorld").

image::dw-tut-helloWorld.png["A DataWeave script that outputs 'helloWorld' in JSON format"]

. Replace the current script in the source code area of the *Transform Message*
tab with this one:
+
[source,dw,linenums]
----
%dw 2.0
output application/json
---
{ myString: ("hello" ++ "World") }
----
+
* The body of the DataWeave script contains a key-value pair
(`{ myString: ("hello" &#43;&#43; "World") }`). The value of this input object
is a DataWeave expression (`("hello" &#43;&#43; "World")`) for concatenating
the strings "hello" and "World" into a single string, "helloWorld".
+
When you are ready, you can learn about the DataWeave
xref:dw-core-functions-plusplus.adoc[++] function used to concatenate the strings.
+
* The header of the script is all the content above the three dashes, `---`.
It includes important directives, including one for specifying the output format
`application/json`. You can learn more about
xref:dataweave-language-introduction.adoc[DataWeave Scripts] when you are ready.
+
. See the JSON output in the *Preview* pane:
+
[source,json,linenums]
----
{ "myString": "helloWorld" }
----
+
. Proceed to <<step_2>>.

[[step_2]]
=== Transform JSON Input to XML Output

Many integrations require transformations from one format to another. This
procedure uses the `output` directive to produce XML output from JSON input.

image::dw-tut-helloWorld-xml.png["A DataWeave script that outputs 'helloWorld' in XML format"]

.  Replace the body of the current script in the source code area with JSON output from <<step_1>>, and change the `output application/json` directive to `output application/xml`:
+
[source,dw,linenums]
----
%dw 2.0
output application/xml
---
{ "myString" : ("helloWorld") }
----
+
. See the XML output in the *Preview* pane:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
<myString>helloWorld</myString>
----
+
Notice that the `"myString"` key of the input JSON object
`{ "myString" : ("helloWorld") }` is converted to the root element of the
XML output and that the concatenated string becomes the value of that XML
object. So the XML output is `<myString>helloWorld</myString>`. That output is
preceded by a standard XML declaration that specifies the XML version and encoding.
+
NOTE: Without a _single_ key to serve as a root node for XML output (for example,
if the input is simply `("helloWorld")`), the transformation to XML will
fail with a yellow warning (*!*) in the source code area. The warning message
is `Trying to output non-whitespace characters outside main element tree`. If
you like, you can try to produce this warning on your own.
+
DataWeave supports many output and input formats. You can learn more about
xref:dataweave-formats.adoc[Supported Data Formats] when you are ready.
+
. Proceed to <<step_3>>

[[step_3]]
=== Learn About Supported Data Types

Now provide a DataWeave script that simply introduces you to a variety of
supported data types and shows how to add comments to a script.

. Replace the current script in the source code area of the *Transform Message*
tab with this one:
+
[source,dw,linenums]
----
%dw 2.0
output application/json
---
{
  /*
   * A multi-line
   * comment here.
   */
  myString: "hello world",
  myNumber: 123,
  myFloatingPointNumber: 123.456,
  myVeryBigNumber: 12341234134123412341234123,
  myDate: |2018-12-07|,
  myTime: |11:55:56|,
  myDateTime: |2018-10-01T23:57:59-03:00|,
  myBoolean: true,
  myArray: [ 1, 2, 3, 5, 8],
  myMixedArray: [ 1, 2, "blah", { hello: "there" } ],
  myObjectKeyValuePair: { innerKey: "innerValue" },
  myObjectWithConditionalField: { a : { b : 1, ( c : 2 ) if true, (d : 4) if false } },
  myNull: null,
  myBinary: "abcd1234123" as Binary
  //A one-line comment here.
}
----
+
DataWeave supports multi-line comments within `/* */` markup and single-line
comments after forward slashes (`//`). It also supports many data types, shown
after the colon (`:`) in key-value pairs, such as `myString: "hello world"` and
`myNumber: 123`. These types include strings (surrounded by quotation marks,
`""`), numbers, date and time structures (within pipes, `||`), Booleans (`true`
and `false`), arrays (within square brackets, `[]`), JSON-like objects
(key-value structures within curly braces, `{}`), `null`, and binaries. When
you are ready for more on this topic, you can review
xref:dataweave-types.adoc[DataWeave types].
+
. See the JSON output in the *Preview* pane:
+
[source,json,linenums]
----
{
  "myString": "hello world",
  "myNumber": 123,
  "myFloatingPointNumber": 123.456,
  "myVeryBigNumber": 12341234134123412341234123,
  "myDate": "2018-12-07",
  "myTime": "11:55:56",
  "myDateTime": "2018-10-01T23:57:59-03:00",
  "myBoolean": true,
  "myArray": [ 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 ],
  "myMixedArray": [ 1, 2, "blah", { "hello": "there" } ],
  "myObjectKeyValuePair": { "innerKey": "innerValue" },
  "myObjectWithConditionalField": { "a": { "b": 1, "c": 2 } },
  "myNull": null,
  "myBinary": "abcd1234123"
}
----
+
. Proceed to <<step_4>>

[[step_4]]
=== Define and Use a DataWeave Variable as Input

Now try a simple DataWeave script that outputs the value of the DataWeave
variable `myJson`. You set the variable using the `var` directive in the
script's header.

. Replace the current script in the source code area of the *Transform Message*
tab with this one:
+
[source,dw,linenums]
----
%dw 2.0
var myJson = { "hello" : "world" }
output application/json
---
myJson
----
+
A JSON object (`{ "hello" : "world" }`) is defined as the `myJson` variable in
the script's header. You can learn more about
xref:dataweave-variables.adoc[DataWeave Variables] when you are ready.
+
. See the output in the *Preview* pane:
+
[source,json,linenums]
----
{
  "hello": "world"
}
----
+
. Proceed to <<step_5>>

[[step_5]]
=== Use a DataWeave Function in a DataWeave Variable

Now try a script that uses the DataWeave `avg` function in a DataWeave
variable (`myJson`) to get averages of two sets of numbers.

image::dw-tut-script-studio-var.png["A DataWeave script using a variable in Anypoint Studio"]

. Replace the current script in the source code area with this one:
+
[source,dw,linenums]
----
%dw 2.0
var myJson = {
  a: avg([1, 1000]),
  b: avg([1, 2, 3])
}
output application/json
---
myJson
----
+
The `avg` functions here get invoked when you add `myJson` to the body of the
script, producing the calculated averages within the JSON object you can see in
the *Preview* pane. The structures `[1, 1000]` and `[1, 2, 3]` are
xref:dataweave-types#dw_type_array[arrays]. You can learn more about
xref:dw-core-functions-avg.adoc[avg] when you are ready.
+
. Preview the output:
+
[source,json,linenums]
----
{
  "a": 500.5,
  "b": 2.0
}
----
+
. Proceed to <<step_6>>

[[step_6]]
=== Read, Transform, and Select Content from an Input

Now try a more complicated script that reads XML input, transforms it to
JSON, and only selects the contents of the `car` element.

. Replace the current script in the source code area with this one:
+
[source,dw,linenums]
----
%dw 2.0
var myRead = read("<car><color>red</color></car>",
                "application/xml")
output application/json
---
{
  mySelection : myRead.car
}
----
+
If you encounter an issue previewing this example, try changing `myRead.car`
to `myRead."car"`. Learn more about the xref:dw-core-functions-read.adoc[read]
function, xref:dataweave-formats.adoc[Supported Data Formats], and
xref:dataweave-selectors.adoc[DataWeave Selectors] when you are ready.
+
. Preview the output:
+
[source,json,linenums]
----
{
  "mySelection": {
    "color": "red"
  }
}
----
+
. Proceed to <<step_7>>

[[step_7]]
=== Read File Contents with a DataWeave Function

[[readurl_ex]] Now use `readUrl` to read the contents of a file in the Studio
`src/main/resources` folder so you can use that content as sample data for a
DataWeave script.

. Add a file by right-clicking the `src/main/resources` folder in the
*Package Explorer* tab, then navigating to *New* -> *File*, providing the file
name `myJson.json` for that file, and clicking *Finish*.
. From `src/main/resources`, provide and save the following sample content in
the *myJson.json* tab (or within the *Source* sub-tab of the *myJson.json* tab,
if it is present):
+
[source,json,linenums]
----
{
  "hello": "world"
}
----
+
.myJson.json in Studio
image::dw-tut-sample-file.png["A Package Explorer tab showing a sample content in Anypoint Studio"]
+
. Returning to the Transform Message component within the *testscript*
tab, replace the current script with one that uses `readUrl` to read the JSON
contents from your file:
+
[source,dw,linenums]
----
%dw 2.0
output application/json
---
readUrl("classpath://myJson.json", "application/json")
----
+
Learn more about the xref:dw-core-functions-readurl.adoc[readUrl] function when
you are ready.
+
. View the matching output in the *Preview* pane.
+
[source,json,linenums]
----
{
  "hello": "world"
}
----
+
Note that you can also load the contents of a file through a metadata type in
the Transform Message component. That procedure is covered later, in
<<med_large_payload>>. It uses the `myJson.json` file you just created.
+
. Proceed to <<step_8>>

[[step_8]]
=== Map Elements from an Array into an Object

Almost all integrations require data mappings. Here, you map elements within
an array to keys and values of a JSON object:

. [[input_map]] Replace the current script in the source code area with this one:
+
[source,dw,linenums]
----
%dw 2.0
output application/json
---
{
  (
    ["a", "b", "c"] map ((value, index) -> {
        (index): value
    })
  )
}
----
+
The `map` function iterates over the array on the left to apply the lambda
(anonymous function) on the right (`((value, index) -> { (index): value })`)
to elements in that array. The lambda uses
xref:dataweave-functions-lambdas.adoc#_use_named_parameters_in_a_lambda[named parameters]
(`value` and `index`) to select the values and indices from the
array and populate a JSON object with key-value pairs. Learn about
xref:dw-core-functions-map.adoc[map], and when you are ready, compare `map`
with xref:dw-core-functions-mapobject.adoc[mapObject], which takes an object as
input.
+
. [[output_map]] Preview the output:
+
[source,json,linenums]
----
{
  "0": "a",
  "1": "b",
  "2": "c"
}
----
+
. Proceed to <<step_9>>

[[step_9]]
=== Pluck Values from an Object into an Array

Now use the DataWeave `pluck` function to iterate over values in a JSON
object and output those values into an array.

. Replace the contents of the source code area with a script that uses
`pluck` on a JSON object:
+
[source,dw,linenums]
----
%dw 2.0
output application/json
---
{
  "0": "a",
  "1": "b",
  "2": "c"
} pluck ((value) -> value)
----
+
Notice that the input object matches the <<output_map, output>>
of the `map` example and that the output array matches the <<input_map, input>>
from the `map` example. Learn more about xref:dw-core-functions-pluck.adoc[pluck]
when you are ready.
+
. Preview the output:
+
[source,json,linenums]
----
[
  "a",
  "b",
  "c"
]
----
+
. Proceed to <<step_10>>.

[[step_10]]
=== Map and Merge Fields

Now try a more complex example that maps and merges fields from items in
separate arrays. The point here is simply to provide a taste of DataWeave's
ability to handle more complex mappings and transformations needed for some
integrations.

. Replace the current script in the source code area with this one:
+
[source,dw,linenums]
----
%dw 2.0
var myVar = [
  { bookId: 101,
    title: "world history",
    price: "19.99"
  },
  {
    bookId: 202,
    title: 'the great outdoors',
    price: "15.99"
  }
]
var myVar2 = [
  {
    bookId: 101,
    author: "john doe"
  },
  {
    bookId: 202,
    author: "jane doe"
  }
]
output application/json
---
myVar map (item, index) -> using (id = item.bookId) {
	"id" : id,
	"topic" : item.title,
	"cost" : item.price as Number,
	(myVar2 filter ($.*bookId contains id) map (item) -> {
		author : item.author
	})
}
----
+
When you are ready to explore the language further, you can learn how the
xref:dw-core-functions-filter.adoc[filter] function used near the end returns
`author` values from the array in the `myVar2` variable. You can read about
xref:dataweave-types-coercion.adoc[type coercion with DataWeave] to see how
`as` works with the data type in the line `"cost" : item.price as Number,` to
coerce input strings like `"19.99"` into numbers like `19.99`. You can see how
`using` (shown in `using (id = item.bookId)`) enables you to create
xref:dataweave-variables#example_local_variable[local DataWeave variables] in a
script.
+
. Preview the output:
+
[source,json,linenums]
----
[
  {
    "id": "101",
    "topic": "world history",
    "cost": 19.99,
    "author": "john doe"
  },
  {
    "id": "202",
    "topic": "the great outdoors",
    "cost": 15.99,
    "author": "jane doe"
  }
]
----
+
. Proceed to <<more_examples>>.

[[more_examples]]
== Try Out More DataWeave Examples

Now you are ready to run DataWeave examples on your own. In your DataWeave
playground, you can run examples from the docs whenever you want to discover
more about the DataWeave language. You can play with the examples and use them
to start your own scripts.

NOTE: For examples that use `payload` to reference input data (such as the
xref:dw-core-functions-contains.adoc#contains1[contains] or
xref:dw-core-functions-mapobject.adoc[mapObject] function examples), you
can avoid payload-related issues by using techniques described in <<provide_payload>>.

. Find many more examples to try out in Studio here:
+
 * xref:dw-operators.adoc[DataWeave Operators]
 * xref:dw-functions.adoc[DataWeave Reference]: Docs on the DataWeave function
 modules provide many examples that use DataWeave functions.
 * xref:dataweave-flow-control.adoc[Flow Control in DataWeave]
 * xref:dataweave-pattern-matching.adoc[Pattern Matching in DataWeave]
 * xref:dataweave-cookbook.adoc[DataWeave Cookbook]
 * xref:dataweave-functions.adoc[Define DataWeave Functions]
+
. Proceed to <<next_steps>>.

[[provide_payload]]
=== Run Examples that Act on a Payload

In DataWeave, `payload` is a built-in Mule Runtime variable that holds the
contents of a xref:mule-runtime::about-mule-message#_message_payload[Mule message]. It enables
you to retrieve the body of a message simply by typing `payload` into the
DataWeave script. The docs often refer to this content as "the payload."

To try out DataWeave examples that use `payload` to get the contents of a
Mule message, you have some options:

* <<small_payload>>: You can use a DataWeave variable.
* <<med_large_payload>>: Add the payload content through a file. This technique
also works for short payloads.

Alternatives that require a running Mule app (such as using
xref:mule-runtime::set-payload-transformer-reference.adoc[Set Payload]) are not covered here
but are introduced in <<next_steps>>.

[[small_payload]]
==== Run Examples with Short Payloads

For short examples with a few lines of sample data, you can convert the input
payload to a variable. You simply copy the payload's content into a DataWeave
variable (`var`) in the header of a DataWeave script. Then, in the body of the
script, you replace `payload` with the name of the new variable to reference
that variable.

. [[payload_to_var]] Start with this script in the source code area:
+
[source,DataWeave, linenums]
----
%dw 2.0
output application/json
---
ContainsRequestedItem: payload.root.*order.*items contains "3"
----
+
Notice that you cannot preview it yet:
+
image::dw-tut-payload-example.png["A DataWeave script that checks if a payload contains a specific item in Anypoint Studio"]
+
. [[modify_payload]] Now modify this example so that it uses some sample input
instead of attempting to use `payload` to input content of a Mule message that
does not exist:
+
.. Add a `myInput` DataWeave variable supplying some input data the script can
read, and change the Mule `payload` variable in the body of the script to the
DataWeave `myInput` variable.
+
[source,DataWeave, linenums]
----
%dw 2.0
var myInput = read("<root>
    <order>
      <items>1</items>
      <items>3</items>
    </order>
    <order>
      <items>2</items>
    </order>
</root>",
"application/xml")
output application/json
---
ContainsRequestedItem: myInput.root.*order.*items contains "3"
----
.. Preview the results:
+
[source,json,linenums]
----
{
  "ContainsRequestedItem": true
}
----
+
When you are ready, learn more about the
xref:dw-core-functions-contains.adoc[contains] function
and about the built-in `payload` variable, in
xref:dataweave-variables-context.adoc[Predefined Variables].

[[med_large_payload]]
==== Run Examples with Longer Payloads

For DataWeave examples with many lines of sample data, consider creating a
metadata type through Transform Message. Metadata types can accept a
local file that contains sample data.

. Use the <<readurl_ex, readUrl>> example to create `src/main/resources/myJson.json` in Studio.
+
You can skip this step if you still have the file in Studio. The next steps
show how to use the contents of this file as your payload.
+
. Now replace the current script from the source code area of the
Transform Message with one that selects the payload of the input:
+
[source,dw,linenums]
----
%dw 2.0
output application/json
---
payload
----
+
. Notice that you cannot preview a payload now because it does not exist yet.
+
image::dw-tut-payload-example2.png["A DataWeave script that checks if a payload contains a specific item in Anypoint Studio"]
+
. Now provide a simple JSON object as the payload of the Transform Message:
+
.. In the *Transform Message* tab, click the _left-most_ rectangle from the
*Preview* button to open the columned, graphical view next to the source
code area:
+
image::studio-define-payload.png["A Transform Message component to define metadata in Anypoint Studio"]
+
If you mouse over that rectangle, you can see the label *Show Graphic*.
+
.. In the left-most column of the *Transform Message* tab, find *Payload: Unknown*, and click *Define metadata*.
+
If you do not see the *Define metadata* link, simply right-click the *Payload:*
entry in the left-most column, and then click *Set Metadata* to open the
*Select metadata type* dialog.
+
. Now load the contents of `myJson.json` (created in
the <<readurl_ex, readUrl>> example) into the Transform Message component:
+
.. Click *+Add* to open the *Create new type* dialog.
.. In the dialog, provide the *Type id* `myJsonType`, and click *Create type*.
+
image::studio-create-type.png["A dialog for creating a new type"]
+
.. Back in the *Select metadata type* dialog that opens, select *JSON* from
the *Type* drop-down menu.
+
image::studio_select_metadata_type.png["A Select metadata type dialog to select Type"]
+
.. Below the new type, change *Schema* to *Example* (as shown above).
.. Use the navigation button with the ellipsis (*...*) to find `src/main/resources/myJson.json`, and click *Open*, which displays the
structure of the file contents (`hello: _String_`) in the *Select metadata type* window.
.. Now click *Select* to load the contents of the file into the message
payload.
.. Notice that the JSON object from `myJson.json` is now in the Preview pane.
+
If necessary, you can click *Preview* to open the Preview pane.
+
.. Now click the _empty_ rectangle next to the *Preview* button to open the source code area, and change the body of the script to `payload.hello`,
retaining the existing DataWeave header content.
+
Notice that the Preview pane now contains only the value of the payload:
`"world"`.
+
Here is what this example looks like in Studio:
+
image::dw-tut-world.png["A DataWeave script that outputs the word 'world' in JSON format in Anypoint Studio"]
+
Learn more about xref:dataweave-selectors.adoc[DataWeave Selectors]
when you are ready.

[[next_steps]]
== Next Steps

* To get started with Mule app development and data mapping through the
Studio UI, see xref:mule-runtime::mule-app-tutorial.adoc[].
* Beyond the Transform Message component, many Mule connectors, modules, and
Core components accept DataWeave selectors and short DataWeave expressions
in their *fx* fields.
+
To learn about the components, you can start from
xref:mule-runtime::mule-components.adoc[Mule Components].
+
To try out sample data in a running Mule app, without relying on external
data sources, you can use these Core components with or without Transform
Message:
+
** xref:mule-runtime::set-payload-transformer-reference.adoc[Set Payload] to provide
content for the payload of a Mule event.
** xref:mule-runtime::variable-transformer-reference.adoc[Set Variable] to create content in
a Mule event xref:mule-runtime::about-mule-variables.adoc[variable].
** xref:mule-runtime::scheduler-concept.adoc[Scheduler] to trigger the regular generation of Mule events.
** xref:mule-runtime::logger-component-reference.adoc[Logger] to view output and issues logged
in the Studio console.

Here is an example that uses some of these components:

image::studio-hello-world.png["A flow that outputs 'helloWorld' in Anypoint Studio"]
